														<h2>Unknown Illness - (June 2021 - ongoing)</h2>
														<p></p>
													</header>

													<p>At the beginning of Summer 2021, I succumbed to some unknown illenss that caused a great amount of abdominal pain 
														and nausea that still has not been cured to this day. After seeing over 10 doctors and over 15 medications the 
														symptoms have not subsided and no diagnosis has been given. 
														Here is a summary of what happened in this Darwinian-Kafkaesque nightmare.
														 Hopefully this can provide helpful information for future problems and those who are curious.
														 Basic info on the right.</p> <hr>

													<h3>June 16</h3>
													<p>On Amoxicillin. From what I remember the dosage was rather strong. Treating tooth infection.
													</p>

													<h3>June 23</h3>
													<p>Finished Prescribed Amoxicillin. Was supposed to get root canal this day but a sore appeared on back of throat,
														 so to be cautious we decide to wait for sore to leave before procedure.
													</p>

													<h3>June 25</h3>
													<p>At around 7pm a stomach ache started. All around abdomen. Felt more painful than the average stomach ache 
														so turned in early at around 9 or 10.
													</p>

													<h3>June 26</h3>
													<p>Stomachache still there, which almost never happens. Noticed sneezing and peeing/pooping made pain worse. 
														Stool was rather odd. It would usually start out as pellets then come out as two or three logs that looked kinda cracked.
													</p>

													<h3>June 30</h3>
													<p>Decided to see a doctor (we will call them D1). D1 diagnosed me wtih constipation, and I was told to drink lots of water,
														 eat vegetables and try IBGard if thigns don't improve. <br><br> Around this time I also notice that the pains eems to be primarily on lower left and
														  right abdomen, with slight pain upper center. (Later doctor told me this is colon and stomach)
													</p>

													<h3>July 3</h3>
													<p>Diet change had no affect, so took IBGard before sleeping. Woke up to unbearable pain that kept me up from around 2:30 - 4:00AM.
													</p>

													<h3>July 4</h3>
													<p>Saw walk-in doctor (D2). Gave me forms for a few blood tests, urine test, xray, ultrasound. H. pylori stool test was given later
														 but could not be taken due to recent antibiotics<br><br>
														Completed Blood and Urine test.
													</p>

													<h3>July 5</h3>
													<p>Did xray (chest and abdomen).
													</p>

													<h3>July 6</h3>
													<p>Did ultrasound (full abdomen).
													</p>

													<h3>July 8</h3>
													<p>Saw doctor (D3) from same clinic as D2. All tests came back normal. No celiac disease or infection found. Stool was 
														found in colon<br><br> Prescribed Senna Tablets, Restoralax, and Metamucil. <br><br> Took all three and noticed pressure inside 
														butt. Stool did come out much softer.
													</p>

													<h3>July 9</h3>
													<p>After taking Restoralax got unbearable pain in abdomen. Stopped taking Restoralax.
													</p>

													<h3>July 10</h3>
													<p>Saw doctor (D4) at different clinic who told me to stop taking Senna Tablets and Restoralax.
														Prescribed antacid Sandoz Pantaprazole 20mg once daily.
													</p>

													<h3>July 11</h3>
													<p>Took antacids. Seemed to help a bit.
													</p>

													<h3>July 12</h3>
													<p>After dinner I had considerable bloating and abdomen swelled up a lot. A lot of internal pressure. <br><br>
														 Had bowel movement with dry stool. Having to pee every hour.
													</p>

													<h3>July 13</h3>
													<p>Stool seems to be back to normal.
														Saw doctor (D5) at same clinic as D2,D3. Told me to double antacid dose, repeat ultrasound, do ova(?) parasite stool test
														and do preemptive treatment of h pylori. Prescribed Amoxicillin, Clarithromycin, Metronidazole. <br><br>
														Completed stool test. Took antibiotics at 2pm. <br><br>
														At 5pm I likely had an allergic reaction. Felt a great weight on chest, difficulty breathing, itchy palms,
														 tingling everywhere, and knees and wrists felt swollen. Abdominal symptoms also much worse.
														  Saw D4 who told me to stop taking my meds and gave prescription if it happens again.
													</p>

													<h3>July 14</h3>
													<p>Stopped taking antacids, antibiotics, Metamucil. Eating makes pain worse and nausea is now also a symptom.
													</p>

													<h3>July 16</h3>
													<p>Got call from D5 saying stool test came back normal and that a referral has been sent to a specialist. <br><br>
														 High pitched ringing also began in left ear. Probably not related to anything but gonna note anyway.
													</p>

													<h3>A sort of interjection/catchup</h3>
													<p>At this point I realized I didn't mention some things that might be worth noting.
														 Water has been tasting weird for the last few weeks. Don't know if its a problem with our house's
														  filtration or not but something I've noticed. Bowel movements have also been difficult.
														   I can only go when I'm like bursting cause its really hard for me to push stool out.
													</p>

													<h3>July 22</h3>
													<p>Bladder now feels kinda weird and tingly. Occasional sharp pains too. Also ringing in ear stopped.
													</p>

													<h3>July 24</h3>
													<p>Tried acupuncture and cupping (with D6). Had a lot of abdominal pain the following night that didn't
														 allow for much consecutive sleep. This will persist for the next two weeks
														  where I wake up around every half hour of sleep.
													</p>

													<h3>July 28</h3>
													<p>Now very nauseous. Thinking about good makes me want to vomit. Eating very little.
													</p>

													<h3>July 30</h3>
													<p>Got Pfizer vaccine dose 2. First dose was on May 20.
													</p>

													<h3>July 31</h3>
													<p>Saw D2 about nausea who told me this is due to a lesser appetite causing a spike
														 in stomach acid levels. Recommended I force myself to eat and drink Ensure Plus
														  as a meal replacement/supplement. <br><br> Took their advice and nausea seems 
														  to have subsided a great amount. Abdomen hurts more though.
													</p>

													<h3>August 1</h3>
													<p>Finally did h pylori test now that I am off antibiotics and antacids. <br><br>
														 Started two Chinese medicines. Not really sure what they are but apparently
														  one of them is meant to relieve pain and cleanse colon and the other coats
														   digestive tract to prevent inflammation. Had diarrhea for 6 hours after
														    taking these medicines.
													</p>

													<h3>August 3</h3>
													<p>Felt relatively okay after waking up but after Chinese medicine i became very
														 uncomfortable. Bladder tingles and I feel a burning sensation from my chest
														  to my groin. Very nauseous again and having to pee a lot despite usual water
														   intake. Pee is clear and there's a lot of liquid coming out each time. Idk
														    where this is coming from.
													</p>

													<h3>August 4</h3>
													<p>H pylori test came back negative. At this point we decide to go the hospital
														 before I die or something. Checked in at 5:15PM, admitted around 9:00PM.
														  Doctor (D7) did some blood tests which came back normal. Assured me
														   everyhting was okay and I should take a PPI for 30 days to see if that helps.
														   Prescribed Pataprazole 40mg for 30 days. Discharged at 10:30PM.
													</p>

													<h3>August 5</h3>
													<p>Stopped taking Chinese medicines. Actually feeling amazing. Pain and nausea basically gone.
													</p>

													<h3>August 7</h3>
													<p>Very intelligently decided I was well enough to exercise. Intense nausea unparallelled by
														 anything I've experienced previously soon followed. Very much want to vomit and lump in
														  throat. These symptoms continue. Very hard to sleep. If breathign slows nausea gets intense
														   and I wake up. Sometimes would wake up with extreme pain and take an hour to fall back asleep.
														   Eating very very little.
													</p>

													<h3>August 8</h3>
													<p>Tried a traditional Chinese medicine called "Lophan Thus" or something.
														 Supposed to help with nausea and boost digestive system.
													</p>

													<h3>August 10</h3>
													<p>Parents contacted reputable Traditional Chinese doctor (D8) who recommended some Traditional Chinese
														 medicine. 3 plants. I'll get the names at some point. Tried some Gaviscon too.
														  Did not notice any change in symptoms.
													</p>

													<h3>August 11</h3>
													<p>Now each time I wake up I'm incredibly warm. Saw doctor (D9) who said the only thing I can really do
														 is keep taking meds and wait for specialist. Ate like my first meal in 3 days though so its getting better maybe.
													</p>

													<h3>August 12</h3>
													<p>Nausea much better but abdomen hurts like hell.
